## 1. Data Structures

### 1.1 Arrays
- **Description**: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.
- **Key Operations**: Access, Insertion, Deletion, Searching.
- **Use Cases**: Storing a fixed-size collection of elements, fast access by index.

### 1.2 Linked Lists
- **Description**: A linear collection of elements (nodes) where each node points to the next node.
- **Types**: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.
- **Key Operations**: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion.
- **Use Cases**: Dynamic memory allocation, when size is unknown ahead of time.

### 1.3 Stacks
- **Description**: A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Key Operations**: Push, Pop, Peek, isEmpty.
- **Use Cases**: Undo/redo operations, balancing symbols in expressions, expression evaluation.

### 1.4 Queues
- **Description**: A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Types**: Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue, Deque.
- **Key Operations**: Enqueue, Dequeue, Front, isEmpty.
- **Use Cases**: Job scheduling, handling requests in a system, breadth-first search in graphs.

### 1.5 Hash Tables
- **Description**: A data structure that stores key-value pairs with a hash function for fast access.
- **Key Operations**: Insert, Search, Delete.
- **Use Cases**: Caching, dictionaries, implementing sets.

### 1.6 Trees
- **Description**: A hierarchical data structure with nodes connected by edges.
- **Types**: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, Heap, Trie.
- **Key Operations**: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Searching.
- **Use Cases**: Hierarchical data storage, searching, priority queues.

### 1.7 Heaps
- **Description**: A special tree-based data structure used for efficient retrieval of the minimum or maximum element.
- **Types**: Min-Heap, Max-Heap.
- **Key Operations**: Insert, Delete, Heapify.
- **Use Cases**: Priority queues, heap sort, scheduling algorithms.

### 1.8 Graphs
- **Description**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
- **Types**: Directed Graph, Undirected Graph, Weighted Graph, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
- **Key Operations**: Traversal (DFS, BFS), Shortest Path, Minimum Spanning Tree.
- **Use Cases**: Social networks, route planning, network topologies.

- **Examples**: N-Queens Problem, Sudoku Solver, Subset Sum Problem.

### 2.6 Divide and Conquer
- **Description**: A technique where a problem is divided into smaller subproblems, solved independently, and then combined to form the solution.
- **Examples**: Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Binary Search.
