// Generic skeleton of a java program
// Consists of two components
// Import statement and the main method

// import necessary libraries
// to use commonly used utility classes in java, import the java.util package

import java.util.Scanner; // import java.util imports all classes and interfaces from the java.util package

//  declare the main method using public static void main(String[] args) {}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}

// You can then use classes from the java.util package, such as Scanner, ArrayList, HashMap, and others, as needed in your Java program. Importing only the classes you use can help keep your code more efficient and maintainable, as you won't have unnecessary overhead from importing unused libraries.

// However, it's essential to be aware of potential compatibility issues and consider the impact on compile time, especially in large Java projects. When you import a broad range of classes or packages, it can lead to longer compilation times and potential conflicts if different classes have the same name in different packages. Therefore, in Java, it's best practice to import only the specific classes or packages you need for your program.
